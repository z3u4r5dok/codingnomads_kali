# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

# I'd like to be able to fix all of my pictures more efficiently
# Automating this activity will save me a lot of time

# Create a code to organize all photos at once
# Automate the order and remove duplicates
# sort them by date and place them in just one place
# use the script for future processes.
