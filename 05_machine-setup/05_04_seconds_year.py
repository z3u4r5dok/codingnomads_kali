# Use the interpreter to calculate how many seconds are in a year.
# Then write the code in this script file below this line.

# Define seconds in an minute
seconds_in_minute = 60

# Define minutes in an hour
minutes_in_hour = 60

# Define hours in a day
hours_in_day = 24

# Define days in a year
days_in_year = 365

# Calculation of seconds in a year
seconds_in_a_year = seconds_in_minute * minutes_in_hour * hours_in_day * days_in_year

print(seconds_in_a_year)

# print("seconds_in_a_year"). Since this is a variable with values is not a string....
